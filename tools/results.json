    "gemini_response": "The video features a woman in a white dress performing intense, almost dance-like movements. She is initially seen holding a long, dark object resembling a sword. The scene then cuts to a formal dinner setting with several people seated at a long table.\n\nAs the video progresses, the woman is seen with increasing amounts of simulated blood on her face, body, and dress, suggesting a violent event. She continues to wield the sword, with blood covering her hands and forearms.\n\nOther figures, some wearing white masks, are shown observing the scene from various levels of a grand, multi-story building. The woman eventually stands on the dinner table, fully drenched in simulated blood, dramatically raising the blood-covered sword above her head.\n\nThe final sequence shows the woman, still covered in blood, sitting at the head of the table, now strewn with other figures lying motionless, also covered in simulated blood. She is seen eating from a plate, seemingly unconcerned, amidst the gruesome scene.\n\n**Notable Objects and Scenes:**\n*   A woman in a white dress, initially clean, then heavily covered in simulated blood.\n*   A long, sharp sword (weapon) wielded by the woman.\n*   A formal dinner setting with a long table, white tablecloth, candelabras, and guests.\n*   Background figures, some wearing white masks, observing from multiple levels of a building.\n*   Extensive use of simulated blood on the main character, the sword, the table, and other figures.\n\n**Risky or Policy-Relevant Content:**\n*   **Violence/Gore:** The video depicts significant simulated gore, including a woman covered in blood, wielding a blood-soaked sword, and a scene of multiple figures lying on a table, seemingly dead or severely injured, and covered in blood. This content is visually graphic and unsettling.\n*   **Weapons:** A prominent sword is featured as a weapon used by the main character in the context of violence.",

    "gemini_response": "The video features scenes from the movie \"John Rabe,\" depicting the Nanjing Massacre.\n\n**Notable Objects and Scenes:**\n\n*   **Nazi Flag (Hakenkreuz flag):** A prominent red flag with a white circle and black swastika is shown multiple times. In several scenes, a large flag is unfurled over crowds of people, seemingly to provide cover or protection.\n*   **People:** Crowds of civilians, including women and children, are shown seeking shelter under the flag and in what appears to be a safe zone.\n*   **John Rabe:** An older man (the actor portraying John Rabe) is seen directing people, and a black-and-white historical photo of the real John Rabe is also displayed.\n*   **Explosions and Fires:** Scenes of night bombings and fires indicate active conflict and danger.\n*   **Historical Documents:** A close-up of an old newspaper or document with images of soldiers is shown briefly.\n*   **Shelter/Safe Zone:** A black-and-white photo shows a Nazi flag draped over what looks like an air-raid shelter entrance. A scene depicts John Rabe interacting with people in a more settled, possibly safe, environment.\n\n**Narrative and Context (from Korean text):**\n\nThe video explains that during the Nanjing Massacre, John Rabe, a German businessman from Siemens China, used a large Nazi flag to protect Chinese civilians from indiscriminate Japanese military bombings and massacres. It highlights a scene from the movie where the flag is actively used to shield people during an attack. The narration clarifies that while the movie scene is \"slightly dramatized,\" Rabe did historically use the flag, not by holding it aloft in the midst of an attack, but by draping it over air-raid shelters where people were hiding. He created a \"safe zone\" with a neutral committee, saving an estimated 150,000 to 200,000 lives from brutal Japanese military actions.\n\n**Risky or Policy-Relevant Content:**\n\nThe video prominently displays the Nazi flag (Hakenkreuz flag), which contains the swastika symbol. This symbol is highly controversial and is widely associated with Nazism, antisemitism, and genocide, causing offense and distress to many. The video presents a complex historical situation where this symbol, due to Nazi Germany's alliance with Japan, was paradoxically used by John Rabe for humanitarian purposes to protect Chinese civilians from Japanese aggression during the Nanjing Massacre. While the video aims to provide historical context for Rabe's actions, the repeated and prominent display of the swastika could be distressing to viewers and requires careful consideration of its impact given its deeply negative connotations.",

The English text states: \"This video is for the purpose of publicizing the evil done by the NAZIS. Please note that video is not meant to defend and praise the NAZIS who committedd horrific atrocities around the world.\"\n*   **0:20-0:23**: A group of men in military uniforms, including Adolf Hitler, are seen on a platform adorned with a large red banner featuring a prominent Swastika symbol.\n*   **0:23-0:31**: Soldiers in various Nazi-era uniforms are shown marching in formation on streets.\n*   **0:31-0:57**: A wide shot of a city street lined with buildings and numerous large red flags, all displaying the Swastika symbol. A marching band in uniform is playing, followed by men carrying more Swastika flags. German song lyrics appear as subtitles, translated into English and Korean, praising the Swastika and those who gather around its symbol. The lyrics include phrases like \"The Swastika in the White Field On Fire Red Ground Gives freely and openly to the whole world The joyful news Whoever gathers around this symbol Is German in soul, meaning, and nature.\"\n*   **0:57-1:00**: Close-ups of men in Nazi uniforms giving the Nazi salute. Swastika emblems are visible on their caps.\n*   **1:00-1:20**: Further shots of men in Nazi uniforms, some with medals, and more soldiers marching in formation, some saluting. The song with its ideological lyrics continues throughout these scenes.\n\n**Risky or Policy-Relevant Content:**\nThe video prominently displays hate symbols (Swastikas) on flags, banners, and uniforms throughout the majority of the runtime. The accompanying German song, translated into English and Korean, explicitly praises the Swastika and equates gathering around it with being \"German in soul, meaning, and nature,\" which promotes Nazi ideology. Despite the initial disclaimer stating the video's intent is to \"publicize the evil done by the NAZIS\" and not to praise them, the extensive display of Nazi symbols and the direct promotion of Nazi ideology through the song lyrics could be interpreted as glorifying or promoting a hate group.",

In the background, explosions begin to occur within the hospital building.\n*   **0:06-0:15:** As the Joker walks, the hospital continues to experience multiple large explosions, sending debris and smoke into the air.

Specifically:\n\n*   **Bombing of a hospital:** A healthcare facility, a place meant for healing and safety, is shown being deliberately destroyed by explosions.\n*   **Bombing of a school bus:** A vehicle associated with children and transportation to educational institutions is shown being intentionally detonated.\n*   **Glorification of violence:** The character, the Joker, is portrayed as calmly orchestrating and seemingly enjoying these acts of destruction, which could be interpreted as a glorification of violence and chaos.\n*   **Real-world harm potential:** While fictional, the depiction of such acts could be disturbing, especially to vulnerable audiences, and potentially inspire or normalize violence.",

    "gemini_response": "The video begins with an establishing shot of a modern house with a swimming pool. It then cuts to a close-up of a laptop screen displaying a social media feed with pictures of young girls. Two girls, both wearing athletic shirts (one in black and blue Adidas, the other in white and blue Adidas), are looking at the laptop. They discuss the photos, with one girl expressing dissatisfaction with her appearance, saying her hair is \"horrible\" and her smile \"looks fake.\"\n\nThe girl in the black and blue Adidas shirt becomes increasingly agitated. She stands up and demands, \"Don't post that picture.\" She then walks away, seemingly angry, and goes into another room, yelling, \"Did you turn it down!\" (implying loud music).\n\nThe scene then dramatically shifts. The girl enters a bedroom with blue walls adorned with posters and a bookshelf. She looks up and gasps, discovering a person hanging from the ceiling by a rope, apparently attempting suicide. The girl immediately rushes forward and desperately grabs the person's legs, trying to lift them and alleviate the pressure on their neck. Close-ups show her face contorted in agony and tears as she struggles to hold the person up.\n\nThe video concludes with a shot of a man in a suit walking quickly and purposefully down a hospital hallway, suggesting the tragic aftermath of the event.\n\n**Risky or Policy-Relevant Content:**\nThe video contains highly sensitive and policy-relevant content, specifically:\n1.  **Depiction of Suicide:** The central and most impactful part of the video is the explicit depiction of a person hanging themselves and another individual discovering them and attempting to intervene. This is a graphic and distressing portrayal of suicide.\n2.  **Emotional Distress:** The video effectively conveys the profound emotional distress and despair of the individual attempting suicide (implied) and the horror and desperate struggle of the girl who discovers them.\n3.  **Potential Link to Social Media and Body Image:** The initial scenes where the girls discuss pictures on social media and one expresses insecurities about her appearance could imply social media pressures or body image issues as a contributing factor to the subsequent tragic event, although this is not explicitly stated.",

    "gemini_response": "This video is a split-screen comparison, with the top half labeled \"모드 영상\" (Modded Video) and the bottom half labeled \"원본 영상\" (Original Video). The main title translates to \"A game mod that reached a singularity less than a month after its release.\"\n\n**Notable Objects and Scenes:**\n\nThe video depicts various scenes from what appears to be an underwater or murky fantasy game setting, possibly a cinematic or in-game sequence.\n\n*   **Original Video (Bottom Screen):** Shows a variety of large, monstrous, or heavily armored humanoid and beast-like creatures. These include:\n    *   A group of armored, somewhat ghoulish or fish-like figures with distinct headgear.\n    *   A large, somewhat fleshy, winged or finned sea monster swimming.\n    *   A bulky, armored creature resembling an ape or gorilla.\n    *   A massive, crab-like or insectoid monster.\n    *   A large, white, whale-like or dolphin-like creature emerging from the water.\n    *   Overall, the original video features non-human, fantasy creatures in a combat or dynamic sequence.\n\n*   **Modded Video (Top Screen):** Shows the *exact same scenes and camera angles* as the original, but **all the monstrous or beast-like creatures have been replaced with human female characters.**\n    *   The armored figures are now human women in armor, often with visible cleavage or tight-fitting gear.\n    *   The large, fleshy sea monster is replaced by a human woman with significantly exaggerated breast size, wearing a bikini top and goggles, swimming.\n    *   The bulky ape-like creature is replaced by a human woman, again with exaggerated breast size, wearing a bikini top and goggles.\n    *   The large, white, whale-like creature emerging from the water is replaced by a human woman, appearing bare-chested or in a very minimal top, with blonde hair, emerging from the water.\n    *   Other monsters are similarly replaced by human women, often in revealing attire or with overtly sexualized features (e.g., exaggerated breasts, visible curves).\n\n**Risky or Policy-Relevant Content:**\n\nThe risky or policy-relevant content in this video lies entirely in the \"modded\" portion. The modification systematically replaces non-human, non-sexualized characters and creatures with highly sexualized human female characters. Key elements include:\n\n*   **Sexual Objectification:** The mod transforms powerful or monstrous figures into human women whose bodies are emphasized, particularly their breasts, and who are often depicted in revealing clothing (bikinis, minimal tops) or positions that highlight their physicality.\n*   **Exaggerated Features:** There is consistent exaggeration of female secondary sexual characteristics (specifically breast size) beyond realistic proportions.\n*   **Implied Nudity:** At least one scene (the character emerging from the water at approx. 0:17-0:20) shows a character who appears bare-chested or in an extremely minimal top, bordering on nudity, where the original featured a non-human creature.\n\nThis video demonstrates a common type of game mod that alters original game content to introduce sexualized female characters, which can raise concerns regarding objectification and the sexualization of fictional content.",

Subtitles: \"Serves you right!\" and \"All of you, always making a fool out of me!\" The music reaches a crescendo of unsettling, frantic sounds.\n\n**Risky or Policy-Relevant Content:**\n\n1.  **Extreme Body Horror:** The scene graphically depicts a horrific transformation where a person's skin sprouts numerous small bumps that then rapidly turn into white, worm-like appendages, completely consuming and obscuring their face and body. This is a strong example of body horror and can be deeply disturbing to viewers.\n2.  **Trypophobia Trigger:** The initial appearance of numerous small, dark holes/bumps on the skin, and especially the subsequent emergence of worm-like strands, is a significant trigger for trypophobia (fear of holes or repetitive patterns).\n3.  **Psychological Distress:** The overall scene is designed to be highly unsettling and frightening, involving themes of non-consensual physical transformation, implied violence (the lunge), and extreme distress. It could cause significant psychological discomfort or trauma for sensitive viewers.\n4.  **Graphic/Violent Imagery:** While not overtly bloody, the graphic depiction of a human body undergoing such a grotesque and agonizing transformation falls under graphic content.",
