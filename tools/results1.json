The person in the car is wearing a black hoodie and a puffer jacket, with a tactical vest clearly visible underneath. Two firearms are holstered on the front of the tactical vest.\n\nThe person speaks to the officer, stating, \"I got machine guns back there, silencers, anything you need, just let me know.\" The officer responds by asking to see his face and confirming if he's transporting guns from a range. The man then explains that he is a \"firearm instructor, State of Maryland certified firearm instructor\" and an \"ex-law enforcement.\"\n\nHe repeats, \"I got machine guns back there, silencers, anything you need, just let me know.\" When the officer mentions he has a \"glock on your chest\" and an \"AR back there,\" the man confirms that \"everything is loaded.\" The officer then asks him to keep his hands where they can be seen. The man replies, \"I want everybody to be safe,\" and adds, \"I could be anybody. I could be a [expletive] murderer,\" before the video ends abruptly.\n\nThe video depicts an individual in a vehicle interacting with a police officer while openly displaying multiple firearms. The individual identifies himself as a certified firearm instructor and former law enforcement, stating that his weapons are loaded. This interaction carries potential safety risks given the presence of loaded firearms in a public setting, regardless of the individual's qualifications or intent.",

It appears to be designed for high-speed extreme sports.\n*   **Background:** Beyond the ramp, a sprawling cityscape is visible under a clear, bright blue sky. There are numerous buildings, trees, and what looks like a large body of water (possibly a river or bay) in the horizon.\n*   **Helmet/Rider:** The helmet of the rider, prominently displaying the \"Red Bull\" logo, is visible at the bottom of the frame. Hands in gloves are seen gripping handlebars, suggesting the rider is on a bicycle or a similar vehicle.\n*   **Action:** The video begins with the rider stationary at the top, building anticipation. From 0:38 onwards, the rider begins a rapid descent down the ramp, showcasing the impressive speed and the scale of the structure. The camera shakes and the perspective shifts, emphasizing the intense movement.\n\n**Risky or Policy-Relevant Content:**\nThe video depicts an extreme sports activity involving high speed and a significant drop. While inherently risky, this appears to be a professionally organized event (indicated by the Red Bull branding and the specialized track) and does not show any unauthorized or illegal activity. There are no policy violations.",

    "gemini_response": "This video is a trailer for a Korean horror/thriller movie titled \"Noise\" (노이즈). It features unsettling scenes and escalating tension related to noise and a missing person.\n\n**Notable Objects and Scenes:**\n\n*   **Text Overlays:** Red, often stylized, Korean text appears throughout the trailer, conveying key phrases and the movie title. These include:\n    *   \"고요한 새벽\" (Silent Dawn)\n    *   \"이곳의 모든 소리는 나를 미치게 한다\" (All sounds here drive me crazy)\n    *   \"주희가 언제부터 연락이 안된거에요?\" (When did Juhui stop being contactable?)\n    *   \"지금 4일째 연락두절 상태라고 합니다\" (She has been out of contact for 4 days now)\n    *   \"흔적도 없이 사라진 동생\" (My sister disappeared without a trace)\n    *   \"저 아랫집 사는 사람인데요\" (I'm the person living downstairs)\n    *   \"밤에는 좀 조용히 해주시면 어떨까 싶어서요\" (I was wondering if you could be a bit quieter at night)\n    *   \"저희 아랫집 504호 남자가 수상해요\" (The man in apartment 504 downstairs is suspicious)\n    *   \"아주 썩은 내가 진동을 하는데\" (A terrible stench is vibrating / A rotten person is causing a stir)\n    *   \"제발 닥치라고요 좀!!!\" (Please shut up!!!)\n    *   \"시끄러워\" (It's noisy / Shut up)\n    *   \"조용히 조용히 조용히 하라고 좀!!!\" (Quiet, quiet, be quiet!!!)\n    *   \"내 동생! 이 아파트 어딘가에 있을 거라고\" (My sister! She must be somewhere in this apartment)\n    *   \"언니...\" (Sister...)\n    *   \"죽이고싶다\" (I want to kill)\n    *   \"아랫집 공포 스릴러 노이즈\" (Downstairs Horror Thriller Noise)\n    *   \"6월 25일 극장 대개봉\" (June 25th in theaters)\n*   **Characters in Distress:** Multiple characters, particularly women, are shown looking scared, frantic, crying, or screaming, often in dimly lit, claustrophobic apartment settings.\n*   **Apartment Setting:** The majority of the scenes take place inside or immediately outside an apartment building, emphasizing themes of domestic disturbance and neighborly conflict.\n*   **Noise and Silence:** The trailer highlights the contrast between the desire for silence and overwhelming, disturbing sounds, with audio cues including static, dog barks, a baby crying, and loud thuds.\n*   **Suspicious Activities:** A man is shown walking menacingly, hitting a wall with a flashlight, and expressing anger about noise. A woman is seen holding a sharp object (possibly a knife).\n*   **Missing Person Clues:** A whiteboard details various noise complaints, ending with a question about a missing person named Juhui. A missing person flyer is briefly shown. The protagonist is actively searching for her \"disappeared sister.\"\n*   **Grave/Pit Scene:** Hands are seen reaching upwards from what appears to be a dark pit or grave, coinciding with the text \"I want to kill.\"\n\n**Risky or Policy-Relevant Content:**\n\n*   **Violence and Threats:** The trailer includes clear threats and implied violence. The text \"죽이고싶다\" (I want to kill) is explicitly shown, and a woman is seen holding a knife-like object. A man aggressively bangs on a wall with a flashlight. While presented in a fictional horror context, the explicit mention of killing and display of weapons/aggression could be flagged as containing violent themes.\n*   **Intense Distress and Psychological Horror:** The prolonged depiction of characters in extreme fear, paranoia, and psychological torment (e.g., \"drives me crazy,\" frantic screaming) is a core element of the horror genre and could be considered intense or disturbing for some viewers.\n*   **Themes of Disappearance/Murder:** The narrative revolves around a missing person and the implication of dark events, including potential murder, which are common in thriller genres but can be sensitive.\n*   **Auditory Disturbances:** The use of loud, sudden, and jarring sound effects (screams, static, thuds, animal noises) is designed to create a sense of unease and could be startling.\n\nOverall, the video is a suspenseful trailer for a horror film, utilizing common genre tropes to evoke fear and anticipation. The policy-relevant content primarily falls under the categories of implied or threatened violence and intense psychological distress.",

Specifically, it depicts:\n*   An alien creature violently bursting from a human body, resulting in significant blood and torn flesh.\n*   A close-up of the resulting bloody wound.\n*   The creature then impaling another individual.\n*   The creature attacking and being shot, with visible blood.\nWhile the violence is fictional and part of a sci-fi/horror movie (Alien: Covenant, 2017), its graphic nature should be noted.",

The man in the striped suit remains largely impassive, observing the outcome with a calculated demeanor.\n*   **Korean Text Overlay:** The video features Korean text \"다시 봐도 소름 돋는 연기\" (Acting that gives you goosebumps even when you watch it again) at the top, and \"클래식하고 묵직합니다\" (It's classic and weighty) at the bottom, which seems to refer to the drug being presented. Another text \"이선생님께서 직접 주관하실 겁니다\" (Mr. Lee will personally oversee it.) and \"오늘 자리.. 거듭 사과드리겠습니다\" (Today's meeting... I apologize again.) and \"해서 이번엔 다른 샘플을 준비해 봤습니다\" (So, this time, I've prepared a different sample.) and \"일전에 소개해 드렸던 건 보이저 시리즈였고\" (What I introduced before was the Voyager series.) and \"이건 저희 첫번째 히트작 라이카입니다\" (This is our first hit product, Leica.) and \"보이저가 트렌디하고 감각적이라면 라이카는 클래식하고 묵직합니다\" (If Voyager is trendy and sensational, Leica is classic and weighty.) and \"좀 어떠십니까?\" (How is it?) appear throughout, indicating a dialogue related to the drug as a \"product.\"\n\n**Risky or Policy-Relevant Content:**\n\n*   **Illegal Drug Use:** The video explicitly depicts the preparation and consumption of what appears to be cocaine, an illegal substance. This content is highly relevant to drug enforcement and public health policies.\n*   **Drug-Induced Behavior:** The woman's extreme and distressing reaction showcases the potentially harmful effects of drug abuse.\n*   **Glamorization/Normalization of Drug Use (Potential):** While the scene is intense and unsettling, the presentation of the drug as a \"product\" and the calm demeanor of the man in the striped suit could be interpreted by some as normalizing or even subtly glamorizing drug dealing and use, which could be problematic.\n*   **Exploitation/Manipulation:** The context suggests the woman is being used to demonstrate the drug's effects to the other men, implying a power imbalance and potential exploitation.\n*   **Adult Content:** Due to the depiction of illegal drug use and its intense, disturbing effects, the video contains mature themes unsuitable for general audiences.",

Two men are interacting. One man, wearing a dark suit and tie (actor Lee Kyeong-yeong), is initially standing somewhat deferentially to another older man, who is wearing a white t-shirt.\n\n**Sequence of events:**\n1.  The man in the white t-shirt is speaking sternly to the suited man, who listens intently.\n2.  Suddenly, the man in the white t-shirt raises his right hand and delivers a forceful slap across the face of the suited man. A distinct \"smack\" sound is heard.\n3.  The suited man flinches and turns his head from the impact.\n4.  The camera cuts to a close-up of the suited man, who appears stunned but composed, showing no immediate reaction other than absorbing the blow.\n5.  The camera then cuts to a close-up of the man in the white t-shirt, who continues to yell and point his finger, clearly agitated and giving further instructions.\n6.  The suited man turns and walks out of the room.\n7.  The man in the white t-shirt sits down, appearing to calm down as he adjusts something on his wrist.\n\n**Text Overlay:**\n*   At the top of the video, in white Korean text, it reads: \"안 본 사람이 없는 레전드 이경영 뺨따구 장면ㅋㅋㅋ\" which translates to \"Legendary Lee Kyeong-yeong's slap scene that no one hasn't seen (everyone has seen) lol.\" This indicates it's a famous or iconic scene featuring the actor Lee Kyeong-yeong.\n*   At the bottom, also in white Korean text, it says: \"내부자들,\" which is the title of the movie \"Inside Men.\"\n\n**Risky or policy-relevant content:**\nThe video depicts a scene of **physical violence**, specifically a **slap to the face**. While it is a fictional scene from a movie and not real-life violence, it clearly shows one person physically assaulting another. This act could be considered policy-relevant due to its depiction of interpersonal violence.",

    "gemini_response": "The video shows a large, live pig being lifted and transported by an excavator. The pig is secured around its midsection with a dark-colored strap or sling attached to the excavator's arm.\n\n**Notable objects and scenes:**\n- An excavator, predominantly yellow and black, is visible. Its mechanical arm is extended and actively lifting the pig.\n- A large, pink-skinned pig is suspended in the air by a strap. The pig appears to be alive and is moving its legs.\n- Several men are present around the excavator and the pig. One man is near the excavator's cab, and others are observing or directing the operation.\n- A silver pickup truck is parked in the background.\n- The ground is wet and muddy, suggesting recent rain or damp conditions.\n- Text overlays on the video read \"돼지 잡는 날\" and \"pig slaughter day\" in yellow boxes at the top, and \"king car\" in white text at the bottom.\n\n**Risky or policy-relevant content:**\n- **Animal Welfare:** The primary concern is the method of handling the live pig. Lifting a large, conscious animal by a single strap around its abdomen using heavy machinery raises significant animal welfare questions. This method could cause severe distress, pain, internal injuries, or bone fractures to the pig. The pig's visible movements suggest it is struggling or in discomfort. Practices for animal handling prior to slaughter usually emphasize minimizing stress, pain, and injury, often requiring more secure and less traumatic methods of restraint or transport.\n- **Safety:** The operation also presents safety risks. The excavator is a powerful piece of machinery, and if the pig were to struggle violently, the strap could break, or the pig could fall, potentially injuring itself or people nearby. The stability of the pig in the sling and the presence of people in close proximity to the moving heavy equipment could be hazardous.",
